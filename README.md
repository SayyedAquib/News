# News-App

In this project, users can read the latest news that I present in crisp format And I Integrated a news API to fetch the country-specific news. It has a very attractive UI and animation. For this project, I used Kotlin language, retrofit to serialize the JSON response, Glide library to fetch the images, Android carousel for swipe up and down animation, Cardview for a rich feel and look to the UI design, and recycler view to show data.
